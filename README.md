 Flappy Bird Game
 
This project is a simple Flappy Bird game built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
The game runs directly in the browser and does not require any external libraries or frameworks.
The player controls a bird that falls continuously due to gravity.
Clicking anywhere on the page makes the bird jump upward.
The goal of the game is to pass through the gaps between obstacles without hitting them.
The score increases every time the bird successfully passes an obstacle.
The game ends when the bird hits an obstacle or touches the top or bottom of the game area.
After game over, the score is displayed and the game automatically restarts.
The game is designed to be played using the mouse only.
To play the game, open the index.html file in any modern web browser and start clicking to keep the bird flying.
